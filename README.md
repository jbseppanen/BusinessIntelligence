The packager run automatically from `react-native run-<*>` will sometimes fail to find all necessary modules. Work around it by killing that packager and running your own with `npm start` in the project root directory.

There is an issue with Xcode 10.2 and Swift modules in React Native. You may need to download [Xcode 10.1](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/).
